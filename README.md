# my-new-start-up-website-
This is my first startup, and I’m treating it like a real product, not just a practice project. I will be updating this website daily — adding new features, fixing bugs, improving design, and pushing updates regularly to GitHub.  This project will grow step by step as I improve it and learn more development skills.
